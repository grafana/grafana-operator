## What is Grafana Operator

Grafana Operator is a Kubernetes operator built to help you manage your Grafana instances and its resources in and outside of Kubernetes.

Whether youâ€™re running one Grafana instance or many, the Grafana Operator simplifies the processes of installing, configuring, and maintaining Grafana and its resources. Additionally, it's perfect for those who prefer to manage resources using infrastructure as code or using GitOps workflows through tools like ArgoCD and Flux CD.
