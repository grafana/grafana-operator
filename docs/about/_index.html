<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>
The Grafana-Operator was initially created by a number of RedHat employees as an internal project to manage there grafana instance.
But the project was never supposed to be a part of a RedHat product and was made open-source with in an external github organization.
And was mostly maintained by few people from the original team that created it.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Current</h2>
<p>
Currently the operator is maintained by Grafana Labs and the original creators/maintainers.
While Grafana Labs maintains the operator, we do not offer any commercial support for it.
Support & Issue triage is done on a best-effor basis.
