{{ template "chart.header" . }}

[grafana-operator](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator) for Kubernetes to manage Grafana instances and grafana resources.

{{ template "chart.typeBadge" . }}{{ template "chart.appVersionBadge" . }}

## Installation

This is a OCI helm chart, helm started support OCI in version 3.8.0.

```shell
helm upgrade -i grafana-operator oci://ghcr.io/grafana/helm-charts/grafana-operator --version {{ template "chart.appVersion" . }}
```

Sadly helm OCI charts currently don't support searching for available versions of a helm [oci registry](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/11000).

### Using Terraform

To install the helm chart using terraform, make sure you use the right values for `repository` and `name` as shown below:

```hcl
resource "helm_release" "grafana_kubernetes_operator" {
  name       = "grafana-operator"
  namespace  = "default"
  repository = "oci://ghcr.io/grafana/helm-charts"
  chart      = "grafana-operator"
  verify     = false
  version    = "{{ template "chart.appVersion" . }}"
}
```


## Upgrading

Helm does not provide functionality to update custom resource definitions. This can result in the operator misbehaving when a release contains updates to the custom resource definitions.
To avoid issues due to outdated or missing definitions, run the following command before updating an existing installation:

```shell
kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator/releases/download/{{ template "chart.appVersion" . }}/crds.yaml
```

The `--server-side` and `--force-conflict` flags are required to avoid running into issues with the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation.
By using server side apply, this annotation is not considered. `--force-conflict` allows kubectl to modify fields previously managed by helm.

## Development

For general and helm specific development instructions please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Out of scope

The chart won't support any configuration of grafana instances or similar. It's only meant to be used to install the grafana-operator.
Deployments of grafana instances using the CRs is supposed to be done outside of the chart.

Currently the plan is not to support networkpolicy. The operators support os diverse configuration that you have to support all options.
It's easier to just manage this configuration outside of the operator.
